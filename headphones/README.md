LANDING PAGE – ALX HTML & CSS Project
This project is a pixel-perfect, responsive landing page built entirely with HTML and CSS, inspired by the Figma design created by Nicolas Philippot (UI/UX Designer).
 It demonstrates strong front-end fundamentals — including semantic structure, accessibility, and responsive design — without using any external libraries or frameworks.
